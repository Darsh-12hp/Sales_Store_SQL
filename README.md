# Sales_Store_SQL

## STORE BACKGROUND
A retail store chain tracks daily sales transactions, including order details, customer info, product categories, order times, and order status.
The business wants to optimize operations, improve customer experience, and increase profitability using data-driven decisions.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
The store doesn’t have a clear idea about :

which products sell the most,
customers' preference,
which items bring in the most profit, and
where things are going wrong in delivery or operations.
Because of this, they are missing chances to earn more, losing customers, and making poor business decisions.

## SOLUTION
They need proper reports and simple insights to understand their sales, customers, and product performance better.

## BUSINESS PROBLEMS
What are the top 5 most selling products by quantity?
Which products are most frequently canceled?
What time of the day has the highest number of purchases?
Who are the top 5 highest spending customers?
Which product categories generate the highest revenue?
What is the return/cancellation rate per product category?
What is the most preferred payment mode?
How does age group affect purchasing behavior?
What’s the monthly sales trend?
Are certain genders buying more specific product categories?
